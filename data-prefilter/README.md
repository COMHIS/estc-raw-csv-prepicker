# field035z-values.csv

All values in the field 035z. These are used to filter out duplicates in the ESTC data. Any id found in this field is either duplicated or outdated and any entries with an id found in this list should be marked as duplicated when processed with the prefilter script.

This data needs to be regenerated (use the fieldpicker script to do this) if there is a new version of the ESTC MARC raw data.
